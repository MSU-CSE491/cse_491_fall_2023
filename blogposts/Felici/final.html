class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this post I will be discussing the &ldquo;Simple and Fast Multimedia Library&rdquo; (SFML). First I will give a brief overview of what the library is, and my experience working with it for the first time. Then I will go into more specific features of the library. I will discuss some classes and features that I found particularly useful or well designed. Finally, I will mention a few of the aspects that I disliked about the library, or at the very least found confusing to use. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the name implies, this library is designed around simple, high level use, with efficient handling of resources of various formats. It is good for creating simple interfaces for an application and managing the graphics, audio, windowing, etc for said interface. I am learning and using SFML to create the interface of a small game application. The SFML is compatible across Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, and can be used across multiple languages. This is useful in my case, as we have developers across multiple systems that will need to reference this library. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My first introduction to the library was the SFML website (https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php). It is a well organized and very detailed site, providing most everything a new user would need. I am glad that there is an official website to reference when learning the SFML, especially one that is well organized. The tutorials tab is particularly helpful, which includes multiple tutorials for setting up and using each module. These tutorials are good for beginners, as they are simple but still provide insight as to how and why the example code is written. The tutorials show off many common functions of classes, along with the correct and incorrect ways to use them. Each tutorial has many small sections of example code that are then given a detailed explanation. Examples build upon each other, and often show various ways a solution can be implemented. This is good for teaching the user, rather than giving them a large, vague block of code to copy. Being a website, the tutorials include links to the API and other sections of the site. This made it easy to find other tutorials and detailed class and function descriptions, as compared to a physical format or third party video tutorial. Another important section is the API tab, which lists the entire API for the SFML. This gives an organized, easily accessible overview of every class in the library and each of their functions. It makes it simple to find the functions for each class and see which classes they inherit from. Another way to learn the SFML is by reading some of the several books written about the library. The site links multiple SFML books on the Learn page. I personally read sections of &ldquo;SFML Game Development&rdquo; by Artur Moreira, Henrik Hansson, and Jan Haller. The book gives a base description of the modules, and then goes into more detail on how they use it for creating their game application. Reading this book was a great way to find example usage of SFML, and it provided more specific use case examples than the website tutorials. Finally, if the user still has questions after reading through tutorials and books, there is a FAQ and Forums section to find help. I&rsquo;m glad this exists on an official website, as it&rsquo;s easier to search for SFML related topics here than on a third party website. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To install SFML, I followed the guidelines on the Download page of the SFML website, as well as a youtube tutorial that explained how to set up a CMake file for CLion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oh-tmxtIrA&amp;t=1156s). I&rsquo;ll provide a brief overview. Going to the downloads page of the website, I selected the latest stable version (2.6.1). I am using CLion not VisualStudio, so I chose one of the GCC MinGW download versions. I made sure to have that MinGW version installed and selected by CLion under Settings&gt;Build,Execution,Development&gt;Toolchains. I downloaded my MinGW version from SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/). Shown below is my CMake file. I was unfamiliar with creating CMake files, so I wrote it two different ways, but either works in the end. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 652.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 652.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The SFML is broken down into five main modules, which are the System, Window, Graphics, Audio, and Network modules. Each is separated into its own sub-library, to keep their code separate and non dependent on each other. This allows a user to include only the modules they want without any excess. One module can run properly without having to include or reference large sections of the rest of the library. I&rsquo;m using the SFML to create an interface for a small game application, so I am only using the graphics and window modules. I&rsquo;m glad I can use these two modules exclusively without having to work around the other SFML modules. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The main purpose of SFML is to load and use multiple forms of media files. However, loading is typically an expensive task. There will likely be many individual files to load, and each may be quite large. Stored outside of main memory, these large files will take relatively long to load. Update functions need to be called every frame of an application, and therefore are called many times per second. Trying to access secondary memory multiple times a second for every resource in the application would be extremely expensive. So, the SFML splits its resource loading into a structure of two classes, which I will refer to as heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight classes are meant to do the expensive tasks a low number of times. They load in the resource from secondary memory once for the application to then grab reference to later. Once this reference is grabbed, it can then be used throughout the application by lightweight classes. These lightweight classes are meant to be instantiated repeatedly throughout many parts of the application. But rather than loading their resources directly from memory, they can ask for a reference from their corresponding heavyweight class. Let&rsquo;s look at sf::Font and sf::Glyph as an example. In this case, sf::Font is the heavyweight class while sf::Glyph is the lightweight class. A font file would include the details for how to display each character that can be used, and is therefore relatively large. It would be expensive to load in this entire set of information each time we wanted to display a character on screen. So, an sf::Font is instantiated once and its loadFromFile function is called once to load the font file from memory. Then, whenever text needs to be displayed on screen, an sf::Glyph can be instantiated and rendered. This would occur every frame, and likely multiple times per frame. The sf::Glyph can ask the instantiated sf::Font for a reference to the correct character to display instead of loading it on its own. This pattern is easy to use and is the same across most of the SFML resource classes. The differing one being sf::Audio which streams in sound samples rather than loading entirely at once, and is therefore handled a bit differently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is a good amount of generic code in SFML as well. Mainly their positioning related classes, such as sf::Vector2 and sf::Rect. I think this is to allow for measuring coordinates and operating on them with datatypes of the user&rsquo;s choosing. They&rsquo;ve made typedefs for common template types that help code look cleaner and shorter. sf::Vector2&lt;T&gt; already has sf::Vector2f, sf::Vector2i, and sf::Vector2u for float, int, and unsigned int. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Following the book I read, it felt fairly simple to use SFML to produce the basic components of a game engine and interface. The majority of the resource loading tasks are done by the library, with a need to just implement a way to organize the loaded information. One is able to create a window and poll for various window and input events. There are classes for rendering shapes with textures. Updates and draw calls can be handled in the window&rsquo;s event polling loop. The functions dealing with rendering are built to be high level and straightforward to use. For example, using sf::View. Treating it like a camera, one would want to determine where it is on the window, move it around the game world, or maybe even rotate and zoom. These functions are already provided, and only a few short parameters need to be passed in. sf::View includes a move, rotate, and zoom functions, and allows setting of size and position relative to the render window. It is nice to have these prewritten, high level functions rather than trying to write them ourselves, even if they are relatively simple. Some examples of how to use these functions are shown below. </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 306.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 306.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I find it strange that there isn&rsquo;t a pre-made, generic resource loader and holder class for SFML. In the book, they explained how most of SFML&rsquo;s resource loading and storage is done in a similar way across resource types. They explain a way of making loading and requesting references generic, so that an inherited class can ask to load by resource type and identifier. An example is shown below. This seems to work and be straightforward for everything other than sf::Audio classes, so I&rsquo;m not sure why it isn&rsquo;t already included in SFML. I imagine most programs using SFML would need to load resources the same way. So, making a generic loader would make things simpler to read and avoid implementation of multiple similar classes. If it were included in the SFML, the user could still choose to use the non generic forms if they wanted to. The example from the book is shown below. </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 485.50px; height: 199.18px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 485.50px; height: 199.18px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There aren&rsquo;t many complaints I have with this library. Mainly the lack of a generic resource loading class, but that isn&rsquo;t all too difficult to implement. There was a small issue I ran into with some class parameters. Some function parameter requirements seemed to no longer match the tutorial page and forum answers. The sf::FloatRect constructor which said it can take four parameters as left, top, width, and height. However, it only seemed to work when I gave it a sf::Vector2f position with a sf::Vector2f size. This was a strange issue as it was described with four parameters in the tutorial, api, and some forum posts, but I could only have it work with the two parameter layout. It turns out I was using a newer version than the latest stable version 2.6.1 that the tutorials and book reference. So this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if you stick with that version. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Overall, I found SFML to be a simple to use library that covered the major needs of an interface for a small game application. It is designed to be simple and efficient. It has modules for multiple resource types that may be needed. It is relatively easy to get into, as the site provides many resources for learning about SFML. </span></p></body></html>
