### Project Specs Group 8 - Manually Defined World

Team Members: Nate Gu, Grant Carr, Lauren Garvey, Evan Orvis

High Level Goals:
- Create a world that can be used by other teams to test their features as well as collect
data from interactions within the world.
- Create an ocean biome that simulates a food chain that allows the player to start as a
lower level fish that can eat other fish and go deeper to become a stronger fish.
- Have enough features implemented for complexity and scalability so that the world is
efficient, complete, and robust for other team’s uses.

Key Features:
- A fully functioning, efficient world where other groups can run simulations, test script
generation, or even interface functionality.
- Allow for agents to be added to the world and interact with others, providing data about
agent behavior.
- The world will contain a multitude of complex agent-to-agent interactions, which can be
used to test the agent’s functionality.
- Will contain a game that the interface groups can use to test their player and agent
groups can use to test their NPCs.
- Will have evolution of the fish in the world as the player progresses through the game.
  
Features Needed From Other Modules:
- We will need the Agent Library group to provide us with many fish-like agents as well as
potentially humans in the ocean and boats or other vehicles roaming on the surface.
- Need to ask the interface group to design and draw an ocean for us.
- Need to ask the interface group to design specific function calls for agent behavior that is
specifically needed for our world.
- Need the Evolving AI Agent group to coordinate with us to implement our fish that evolve
throughout the game.
- Need the interface group to create a player for us to test our game with.
- Need the data collection group to provide us data about our world and how it is
performing.

What Makes This Project Challenging:
- Creating functioning interactions that allow a food chain to be simulated realistically.
- Using an AI/ML model to evolve the fish periodically as the player is either playing or as
the player wins the game.
- It will be challenging to implement all of the features that we listed out above, it will take
time and probably a lot of debugging.
- It will be quite challenging to implement the physics of being underwater.
- It will be challenging to design all of the graphics needed for this world
