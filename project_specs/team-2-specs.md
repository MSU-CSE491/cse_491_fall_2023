# Overall Goal
Create a module that collects various meaningful information from the agents and the world. This information will then be interpreted and reported back to their respected module.

# Planned Features
- # For other modules to use
    - Methods to collect user feedback in improving the game
    - Real time data reporting for certain states or actions
    - A data analysis tool to upgrade stats
- # Needed from other modules
    - An interface between their module and ours to collect state information.
    - A heuristic to which data is sent to our module (time interval, frame based, actions, etc)
    - Database and API from the network group
    - UI interface built to display graphical data
# Challenges
 - Technical limitations depending on the tools and resources given to us
 - Specific implementation of collecting the data
 - Keeping constant communication with other modules for what data to collect
 - Complexity of algorithms that we implement
 - Making sense of large complex gameplay data sets
