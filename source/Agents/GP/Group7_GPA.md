# Group 7 GP Agent

# Release Freeze Update:

Here is our plan @mercere99

Things to get done ( Group 7)

- Implement better fitness functions ** Undecided**
  - implementing A* as another sensor

- Saving the state of the best agents overall: **Rajmeet**

- CGPA: **Simon**
  - Crossover: Graph (goes in the base GP class)

- HPCC: **Aman**
  - Serialization? just of the genotype
  - adding in multithreading for mutation
  - multiple start positions

- Integration testing?

- Crossover for LGPA
  - Generate a new list using two parents.

- Export (waiting on the worlds)

- LGPA agent: **Jason**
  - get the current pure virtual functions working
  - tests


Things to ask
-  Ask world groups: what agents do they want (attack, chase, etc) with a decent description of the world.
- Data collection team (we're getting data from them)

Goals to achieve by the end:
- End up with agents that exhibit semi intelligent behavior (they can chase the player around, attack, do whatever the world wants them to do)


# Demo October 18th
## Current progress:
- [x] Sensors for the agent
  - [ ] provide fixes for the sensors <span style="background-color: #FF6347; color: #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Fixes</span>
  - [ ] make sensors agnostic to wall type. 
    - make it so that the sensors can detect walls/impenetrable object of any type
    - <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Integration</span> with Team 1's Library
  - [x] tests for the sensors
- [x] Registers for the agent
  - [x] provide fixes for the registers <span style="background-color: #FF6347; color: #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Fixes</span>
  - [x] tests for the registers

## Currently working on:
- [ ] LGP agent <span style="background-color: #66CDAA; color: #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Released Experimentally</span>
    - [ ] LGP agent tests ?? 
- [ ] CGP agent <span style="background-color: #FFFF00; color: #000000; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">In Development</span> and close to experimental.
    - [ ] CGP agent unit tests  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00; color: #000000; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">In Development</span> 
- [ ] GP loop <span style="background-color: #87CEEB; color: #000000; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Started Development</span>
- [ ] documentation 
- [ ] Make minor modification for `GP agent base` class.


## Future work:
- [ ] GP loop
  - [ ] GP loop tests
    - [ ] unit tests
    - [ ] integration tests
    - [ ] performance tests
  - [ ] Look into parallelization of the GP loop
  - [ ] deploying in hpcc??
  - [ ] implementation for scavenger queue?

- [ ] Training on a sample world.
  
Current Plan:
- check the validity of gp loop by testing it on a public gp project
- run LGP agent on a sample maze world and make markers for Euclidean distance traveled and time taken/steps taken.
- (unsure) run each agent from different starting points to ensure that there is no starting bias??
- (unsure) potentially start a blind run after initial approval from instructors about LGPA and CGPA.

## Question for others:
- Structure for actions: are we going to have access to all the actions all of the time or will it just be a subset?
- Expected behavior for agents: what are some exceptions for the automated agents?
- Integration Testing: How to test CGP and LGP agents?
- Integration Testing: How to test GP loop?
- Testing: How to test on training data?


## PR Review mentions:
- Refactor: Move Sensors up to core?? as it is agnostic to the agent type.
  - is it useful to any other group??
- Direction behavior: is direction behavior useful for an agent? which way an agent is pointing?
  - should this be moved up?
- Refactor: Refactor Experimental Macros?
  - is it useful to any other group??

## Notes:
- potentially move the sensors up to core or agent base.(TBD)
- potentially move the direction behavior up to core or agent base.
- ~~potentially move the experimental macros up to core or agent base.~~
- load and save functions for LGPA for testing.
