# Graphing in Python

Using Python with Pandas for data visualization has several advantages over C++.
One key advantage is the simplicity and readability of Python code,
making it more accessible for data analysts and scientists who may not have a strong 
programming background. Pandas provides a high-level interface to data manipulation
and integrates seamlessly with popular plotting libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The ease of syntax and the extensive documentation of Python and Pandas enable quicker
development and iteration. Additionally, Python has a vibrant and active community,
leading to a wealth of third-party packages and resources for data analysis and
visualization. In contrast, C++ is a lower-level language, and while it offers high
performance, it typically involves more verbose code and a steeper learning curve. 
For data-centric tasks, Python and Pandas provide a more efficient and user-friendly
environment, allowing developers to focus on insights rather than wrestling with complex
syntax and memory management.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to install the following Python packages:

### 1. Pandas

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library.

To install Pandas, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### 2. Matplotlib

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a plotting library for the Python programming language.

To install Matplotlib, run the following command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### 3. NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

To install NumPy, run the following command:


pip install numpy


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dradcl/cse_491_fall_2023_group2
cd source/DataCollection/GRAPH
```

2. Run the Python script `ItemGraphPlotter.py` using the following command:

```bash
python ItemGraphPlotter.py gridPositions.json
```

Replace `gridPositions.json` with the path to your JSON file containing grid positions data.
