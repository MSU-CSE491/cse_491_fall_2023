/**
 * This file is part of the Fall 2023, CSE 491 course project.
 * @brief A common interface class for core objects that sets up required functionality.
 * @note Status: PROPOSAL
 * 
 * This CoreObject class builds an interface for all of the core object, ensuring that
 * they can be properly serialized.
 * 
 * Derived classes must implement:
 *  GetTypeName_impl() - To return the qualified type name.
 *  Serialize_impl() - To store the object in a stream.
 *  Deserialize_impl() - To restore the object from a stream.
