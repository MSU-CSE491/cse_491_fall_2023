## Documentation

#### Code Style
1. Code should be styled according to the [Google C++ Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)  
2. All code should be contained inside of the namespace `walle`
3. If your text editor doesn't have a built-in linter/formatter, use
   `clang-format` with the `--style=google`


## Goals 

#### Library Functions
Implement a set of common library functions that interface with the other
modules.

##### Path algorithms
1. `get_shortest_path(start : Point, end : Point, map : grid)` 
   i. A* search to get path between start and end point on map  
   ii. Returns : List of instructions to navigate from start to end  
   iii. Exact actions and return values will be dependent on the Agent calling
   the function

2. `get_random_path(start: Point, num_moves : int, map: grid)` 
    i. Return a list of actions of len num_moves

3. `walk_route(start: Point, end: Point, pace: double)`
    i. find certain path between two points
    ii. walk between the path between the two points at certain pace


#### Interaction Functions
1. `is_colliding(agent1 : Agent, agent2: Agent)`  
    i. Checks the position of agent1 in relation to agent2   
    ii. Returns true if there is overlap between agent1 and agent2

2. `can_see(agent1: Agent, agent2: Agent)`  
    i. Returns true if agent2 is in line of sight of agent1

3. `damage(agent1 : Agent, agent2 : Agent)`
    i. Changes the health points of agent2 by the number of damage points
    agent 1 is able to do.

4. `heal(agent1 : Agent, agent2 : Agent)`
    i. Changes the health points of agent2 by the number of heal points
    agent 1 is able to do.

5. `interact_with_object(agent: Agent, object: Object, action: Action)`  
    i. Performs action on object
    ii. Returns bool if action was successful  
    iii. This is a placeholder as we learn more about how the agent can
    interaction with objects in the world this will occur

6. `interact_with_world(agent: Agent, world: World, action: Action, point: Pos)`
    i. Performs an action at a certain position
    ii. Returns bool if action was completed

#### Grid-fill algorithms
1. `flood_fill(start: Point, map: grid, criteria: callable, action: Action )`   
    i. takes action to the left, right, up, and down from the start point if the
    grid point matches the criteria
    
2. `game_of_life()`   
    i. Allow for automation of objects based on the rules of [Conway's Game of
    Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)  
    ii. Params and returns will be added after discussion with other groups to
    see if this is wanted
